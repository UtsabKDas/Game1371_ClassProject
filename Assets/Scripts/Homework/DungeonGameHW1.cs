        // TODO B4: In the appropriate room, add a goblin. The goblin attacks the
        //          player and the player attacks the goblin. Use the variables
        //          you've created in PART A to simulate this with code. After the
        //          simulation is done, Print both healths, then print whether or 
        //          not the goblin is defeated. 

        // TODO B5: Add a new room somewhere before the exit that has a merchant. 
        //          The merchant sells potions for 5 gold each. Print how many
        //          potions you can afford and how much gold you will have left over. 

        // TODO B6: Add a defense stat (declare it up top with the others). Use it
        //          in your combat so the goblin's hit damage is reduced by your
        //          defense and your hit damage is reduced by the goblin's defense
        //          Then, add an item that raises defense in a room.
